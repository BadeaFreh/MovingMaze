# MovingMaze

Every character in the game concludes of multiple objects (parent-child heirarchy)
including the maze itself which has a glass and obsticles children that move with the parent

the game is won once the player managed to get the dull to the lower area of the maze
where the glass is not covering ... and then clicks on it
